# Wallpapers

This directory holds wallpapers of amazing artists. It acts as a source to bootstrap my wallpapers on newly created systems and also to keep track of the artist list.

## Original artwork

Almost all the images are downloaded directly from [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net). You can find the artist, and also the original artwork by going to 'https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/<file name without "_p0">'.
